# Awesome Ethereum Dev üöÄ

A curated list of resources for learning Ethereum development.

## Basic Ethereum concepts üßë‚Äçüíª

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (DApps). DApps are applications that run on a peer-to-peer network, instead of on a centralized server. Ethereum uses smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.
